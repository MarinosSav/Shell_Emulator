# Unix Shell and Memory Heap Emulator
A project aimed at implementing a Unix shell similar to "sh" and "bash", as well as a custom memory heap allocator using C.

The shell emulator handles command sequences of 3 or more. It also supports pipes, subshells, and commands such as "exit" and "cd". 

The memory heap allocator handles operations such as "malloc", "calloc", "realloc" and "free".

The repository only contains my code and none of the testing framework.
